<p  >  In a beautiful quiet and intricate city nestled in the heart of Accra, lived a young, passionate and energetic boy full of curiousity.
    He schooled near the city in a place called University Basic School. His name was Gillies Davidson.
    <p>One  day in school, a girl was transferred to his school. She was light - skinned with short black hair and dimples that showed whenever she smiled her gorgeous smile.
    She had curves in the right places, her oval face accompanied with her pale pink lips really brought out her eyes. Her name was Danielle.
      This is where the journey started.</p><p> Gillies was soo fascinated with this girl, he couldn`t concerntrate that day. </p> <p></p>
